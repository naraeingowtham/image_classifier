# Project: Cat & Dog Image Classifier

### By: Naraein Gowtham G A

### Project Goal
This is an image classifier to tell the difference between pictures of cats and dogs.

### Tools I Used
I built this in a Google Colab notebook using Python. The libraries I used were:
- TensorFlow & Keras:
- Matplotlib & Seaborn:
- Transfer Learning:

### How to Run It
The entire project is in the `Image_Classifier.ipynb` file.
1. Open it in Google Colab.
2. Set the runtime to GPU (`Runtime` > `Change runtime type` > `GPU`).
3. Run all the cells (`Runtime` > `Run all`).
